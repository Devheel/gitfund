### Motivation

As software eats the world, it is critical that we find a way to sustainably  
fund the open source ecosystem. [GitFund] is setting out to solve this problem  
by creating a crowdfunding platform for open source projects.

You can find out more on the project page on GitFund itself:

* https://gitfund.io/tav/gitfund

### Community

You can join the community via either our [Slack channel] or IRC:

* `#esp` on `chat.freenode.net`

Both channels are connected by a relay bot, so you won't be missing out on any  
discussions by choosing one over the other.

### Contribute

To contribute any changes, simply fork this repo and send a [pull request].  
Please make sure to add yourself to the `AUTHORS.md` file if you aren't already  
on there. Thanks!

### Structure

The code is currently structured into the following top-level directories:

* `/cmd` — this houses the code for command line executables.

* `/mvp` — the Python App Engine app that powers the current GitFund site.

### License

All of the code in this repository written by the [AUTHORS] has been released
