*If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or would like to access or
seek correction of your Personal Data, or have a related complaint, then please

GitFund is a crowdfunding platform for open source projects. It is operated by
Espians LLP (hereinafter referred to as **"Espians"**, **"we"**, **"us"**, or
**"our"**), a company incorporated in England and Wales.

We respect your privacy and will take all reasonable steps to safeguard and
protect your information as if it was our own.

### Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to [gitfund.io](https://gitfund.io), any APIs,
communications and services we offer relating to GitFund (collectively referred
to as the **"Platform"**).

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any website, product or service of any
third party or other websites/platforms operated by Espians.

### Agreement

By using the Platform, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy
Policy. If you do not agree:

* Please close any accounts you may have on the Platform,

* Delete this site and any associated cookies from your browser,

* And do not visit or use the Platform again.

Any continued use of the Platform will signify your acceptance of this Privacy
Policy.

### Definitions

**"Data Controller"** means Espians, the company responsible for the use and
processing of Personal Data.

**"Personal Data"** means information (whether by itself or in conjunction with
other information in the possession of, or likely to come into the possession
of, the Data Controller) that can be used to identify a specific living person.

### Website Usage

Like most website operators, we collect non-personally-identifying information
of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as:

* Browser version

* Language preferences

* Referring site

* Date and time of each visitor request

And certain Personal Data like:

* Internet Protocol (IP) addresses

Our primary purpose in collecting such information is to better understand how
our visitors use the Platform. And we may make some of this information
available to the public in pseudo-anonymised forms or in aggregate, e.g. as a
report on usage trends.

We may also associate some of that information with any other data that we have,
personally-identifying or otherwise, for various purposes, e.g. fraud detection
and prevention.

### Marketing Emails

If you have signed up on the Platform or have shared your email address with us
in some other way, we may occasionally send you marketing emails about
promotions or new services.

You can opt out of these through the unsubscribe link included in such emails or
through the "List-Unsubscribe" feature in supported mail agents.

Please note that opting out only stops us from sending marketing emails to you.
You will still continue to receive certain emails relating to your account, e.g.
password reset emails, etc.

### Online Tracking

We use cookies to help us identify/track visitors and their usage of the
Platform. Please see our [Cookie Policy][cookies] for more details.

We also use other client-side storage mechanisms like `localStorage` and
`IndexedDB` to store information relating to visitors, e.g. what notifications
have been seen, saving drafts while offline, etc.

In addition, we sometimes use web beacons and tracking links in our emails and
other forms of communications to determine whether they have been
opened/clicked.

### Data Collection

In addition to the methods described above, we also receive, store and process
information, including Personal Data, through a number of different ways.
Examples include when you:

* Interact on the Platform in any way, such as to upvote an issue.

* Fill in any form on the Platform, such as when you sign up or fill in personal
  and financial information in order to sponsor a project.

* Communicate with us.

* Respond to any surveys we send out.

* Link your account on a third party site (e.g. Twitter) to your account on the
  Platform.

Visitors can always refuse to supply information, including Personal Data, with
the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities, and
potentially result in any account they have being closed.

We may also obtain information about you or your company from trusted third
parties such as tax authorities, risk management services, regulators, etc.

various reasons, including those necessary to:

Besides your name, none of the Profile Information is mandatory, and any

any time.

In addition to your Profile Information, any Personal Data you post as part of
user-generated content on the Platform is available to the public without any
expectation of privacy or confidentiality.

This may include any Personal Data you post as part of comments, issues, project
info, updates, testimonials or other features on the Platform that are visible
to the general public.

All such publicly displayed Personal Data will be viewable by any and all
visitors to the Platform, including search engines and users of our API. Please
bear this in mind when deciding what to publish.

If you are unable to remove any Personal Data that you wish to remove from
content that you have posted, please contact team@gitfund.io. We will let you
know if we are unable to do so for any reason.

Please note that even if you remove Personal Data that has been publicly shared,
copies of your Personal Data may remain viewable in caches, search engines, and
archive copies that others may have made.

So please be extra cautious when sharing Personal Data.

### Marketing Use

We may use parts of your publicly shared information, including your Profile
Information that may contain some Personal Data, for display in other parts of
the Platform for marketing purposes.

### Cross Border Data Transfers

We may transfer, store, use and process your information, including any Personal
Data, to territories located outside of your home country including the United
States and possibly other countries. By using the Platform, you consent to
transferring your data to these territories.

### Sharing/Disclosure of Personal Data

We will share your Personal Data with third parties only in the ways that are
described in this Privacy Policy. We do not sell or rent your Personal Data to
third parties.

We may disclose Personal Data we collect about you to members of Espians, our

Platform.

These third parties may include our agents, related bodies corporate,
contractors, financial institutions, payment processors, cloud service
providers, verification services and regulators, as well as any third parties
that you have directly authorised to receive your Personal Data.

In addition, other circumstances where your Personal Data may be transferred,
stored, used, processed and disclosed are as follows:

* As aggregated data:

  * We may aggregate your information with others, such that it can no longer be
    reasonably associated with a specific person, which we may then share with
    third parties or make publicly available.

* With your consent:

  * We will disclose your information if you have explicitly agreed that we may
    do so. We will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your
    information.

* To report suspected illegal activity:

  * We may disclose your information to appropriate third parties, such as law
    enforcement and regulatory bodies, if we suspect that you might be involved
    in any form of illegal activity.

* To protect our interests:

  * We may disclose your information if we feel this is necessary in order to
    protect or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our
    users, employees, members of Espians, and/or to ensure the safety and
    security of the Platform, individuals, and/or the public at large.

  * We may also disclose your information in order to respond to claims asserted
    against us, or to enforce and administer our agreements with users, such as
    our [Terms of Service][terms] and this Privacy Policy.

* By regulators and certification bodies:

  * We may disclose your information with third parties as necessary to comply
    with the requirements of regulatory and/or certification bodies.

* If required by law:

  * We will disclose your information if we believe in good faith that we are
    permitted or required to do so by law, including in response to a court
    order, subpoena or other legal demand or request, including those related
    to national security and law enforcement.

* By service providers:

  * We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside
    of your home country, to provide us with certain specialised services
    related to the Platform.

    These third parties will have access to certain information about you, but
    only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide
    their services to us.

* To support the Platform:

  * We may disclose your information to third parties for the purposes of fraud
    prevention, risk assessment, investigation, customer support, product
    development, or troubleshooting.

* By users of our API:

  * Any information you choose to make public on the Platform, including any
    Personal Data that may be part of your Profile Information or user-generated
    content that you have published, will be accessible to third parties through
    our developer API.

* As part of our embeddable widgets:

  * Any information you choose to make public on the Platform may be embedded on
    third party websites and/or apps, through our embeddable widgets.

preserve and disclose your information, including your account information and
Personal Data, for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

### Use of Online Third Party Services

We make use of the following online third party services which may result in
Personal Data about you being shared with them:

* We use [Amazon Route 53] and [DNS Made Easy] to handle our DNS. By connecting
  to any of the hosts we use to run GitFund, your IP address may become visible
  to these service providers.

* We use [Fanout] to broadcast real-time messages. They will be able to see
  details like your IP address and browser. See their
  [Privacy Policy][fanout-privacy] to better understand how they process and
  handle data.

* We use [G Suite] to handle our email and shared documents. See [how Google
  protects your data][google-data] to better understand how that data is
  processed and handled.

* We use [Google Analytics] for website analytics. See their [data privacy and
  security][google-analytics-data] page to better understand how they process
  and handle data.

* We run GitFund on top of the [Google Cloud] infrastructure. See their
  [Platform Security][google-cloud-security] page to better understand how they
  store and protect data.

* We use [KeyCDN] as a content distribution network. See their [Privacy Policy]
  [keycdn-privacy] to better understand how they store and protect data.

* We use [Mailjet] to send emails. See their [Privacy Policy][mailjet-privacy]
  to better understand how they process and handle data.

* We use [Stripe] for handling payments. See their
  [Privacy Policy][stripe-privacy] to better understand how they process and
  handle data.

Where possible, we've striven to choose services that are compliant with privacy
laws such as EU Data Protection regulations, and have a good reputation with
regards data security.

### Data Security

We maintain strict administrative, technical and physical procedures to help
protect your Personal Data against unauthorised access, misuse, destruction or
alteration.

For core team members (i.e. members of Espians, our employees, and contractors),
we limit access to confidential information (through user/password credentials
and software systems) to those who require it to perform their job functions.

We may store and process your Personal Data in locations outside of our direct
control, for example, on servers or databases managed by cloud hosting
providers.

We use the industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to
safeguard sensitive information as it travels over the Internet to/from our
application servers.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet, and no method of storing
electronic information, can be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the
absolute security of your transmissions to us and of your Personal Data that we
store.

### Data Breaches

We monitor our systems for potential data breaches, and, assuming we have a
contact email address for you, will inform you of any breaches that we detect
relating to your account or Personal Data.

We minimise the impact of such breaches by never storing certain highly
sensitive data such as credit card numbers on our database or servers. They are
instead stored at trusted third parties like [Stripe].

### Child Privacy

We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age
of 13. If you are under 13 years old, please do not send any Personal Data
to us.

If we learn that we have inadvertently collected Personal Data from a child
under age 13, we will remove that information as quickly as possible. If you
believe that we might have any Personal Data from or about a child under age 13,
please contact us at team@gitfund.io.

### Retention of Personal Data

Though we do not have this measure in place for this MVP, we will retain
Personal Data for only as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) it was
collected for.

The exception to this will be in cases where we are obliged to retain the data,
e.g. to comply with legal requirements, ensure transactions are appropriately
processed, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce our [Terms of
Service][terms], etc.

Accordingly, even if you close your GitFund account we will retain certain
information as necessary to meet our obligations. However, we will mark your
account as "closed" and limit access to the available information for only
specific purposes.

### Accessing/Amending Personal Data

Please write to team@gitfund.io if you would like a copy of the Personal Data
that we hold about you. We will provide you with a copy of the data in [JSON
format] as soon as practicable.

If you would like the copy in paper form, then we may have to charge you a fee
depending on where you live. We may also need proof of identification and
authorisation in some cases.

If any of the Personal Data we hold about you is inaccurate or you would like to
request the erasure of Personal Data about you, please let us know and we will
make the changes on our system.

However, we may not be able to carry out your request in all circumstances, e.g.
if we need to retain the historic data in order to comply with regulatory
requirements, etc.

We aim to acknowledge receipt of all access and amendment requests within five
business days and to resolve them within a month at the latest. We will let you
know if this is not possible for some reason.

### Business Transfers

In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganisation, sale of assets,
bankruptcy, or other similar events, certain information in our possession,
including your Personal Data, may be transferred to our successor or assign.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any successor or assign
may continue to use your information, including your Personal Data, as set forth
in this Privacy Policy.

### Changes to this Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice, at our
sole discretion. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any
such changes.

Your continued use of the Platform after any change in this Privacy Policy will
constitute your acceptance of such change.
