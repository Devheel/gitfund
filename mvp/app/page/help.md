Common Issues:

[TOC]

### How do I update my donation/sponsorship details?

You can update your details via the [manage subscription page](/manage.subscription).

### Are my contributions tax-deductible?

You should check with a tax professional in your country to be sure, but for
most countries, the amount you contribute as part of your sponsorship will not
be tax-deductible.

### How do I get invoices?

We will only be adding support for auto-generated invoices (including VAT
invoices and credit notes) as part of our Beta. If you need invoices before
then, please email team@gitfund.io and we will manually generate them for you.

### Why is my sponsor image showing my personal profile picture?

We use the [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) service in order to
automatically find profile pictures based on email addresses. A lot of people
already have a Gravatar profile as it is used by popular services like
WordPress.

You can override the default by uploading the appropriate sponsor image via the
[update sponsor profile](/update.sponsor.profile) page.

### How do I change the email address for my account?

Sorry, we haven't yet implemented support for changing the email address
associated with an account. We will do so for the Beta release though.

### How do I change my password?

We use a passwordless system to authenticate users on the site. When you want to
sign in, we'll send you an email that contains a special authorized link.

### How do I cancel my donation/sponsorship?

You can do so via the [cancel subscription page](/cancel.subscription).

### Why are displayed details not up-to-date?

In order to make the site load faster, we make extensive use of caching. This
sometimes results in stale information being shown for some time until the
caches get updated.
