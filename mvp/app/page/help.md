FAQ:

[TOC]

### Can I get invoices for accounting?

We are currently building the system to autogenerate invoice PDFs. You will be
able to download them from the [transaction history page](/transaction.history)
within two weeks after we publicly announcing the project.

### Is it possible to sponsor via bank transfer?

We are ideally trying to get everyone to sponsor using credit/debit cards so as
to validate our model of using Stripe to handle sponsorship contributions. If
you are not able to pay by card for some reason, then please email
team@gitfund.io and we'll try and work something out.

### How do I update my sponsorship details?

You can use the [manage sponsorship page](/manage.sponsorship) to update your
details.

### How do I cancel my monthly sponsorship?

You can use the [cancel sponsorship page](/cancel.sponsorship) to do so.

### What happens if you don't raise your base target?

If we haven't reached the base target within 4 months of announcing the project,
then, depending on the amount raised and our costs (especially with regards to
legals and compliance), we will either:

* Continue with the project â€” albeit delivering at a slightly slower pace than
  expected.

* Put the project on hold and cancel any further payments from sponsors. Leaving
  everything we'd done as open source.

### How do I change the email address for my account?

Sorry, we haven't yet implemented support for changing the email address
associated with your account. We will do so in the future though!

### How do I change my password?

We use a passwordless system to authenticate users on the site. When you want to
sign in, we'll send you an email that contains a special authorised link.

### Why do I have a blank profile picture?

We use the [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) service in order to
automatically find profile pictures based on email addresses. A lot of people
already have a Gravatar profile as it is used by popular services like
WordPress.

If you would like to have a profile picture, please sign up on
[Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) using the same email address you used on
GitFund, and upload the picture you would like to use.

### Why are displayed details not up-to-date?

In order to make the site load faster, we make extensive use of caching. This
sometimes results in stale information being shown for some time while the
caches get updated.
