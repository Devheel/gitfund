FAQ:

[TOC]

### How do I update my sponsorship details?

You can update details via the [manage sponsorship page](/manage.sponsorship).

### How do I get invoices?

You can find invoice PDFs on the [billing history page](/view.billing.history).

### Why is my sponsor image showing my personal profile picture?

We use the [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) service in order to
automatically find profile pictures based on email addresses. A lot of people
already have a Gravatar profile as it is used by popular services like
WordPress.

You can override the default by uploading the appropriate sponsor image via the
[update sponsor profile](/update.sponsor.profile) page.

### What happens if you don't raise your base target?

Hopefully there will be enough interest in supporting the open source ecosystem
for us to raise well beyond our base target.

But if by the end of September 2017 we still haven't reached it, then, depending
on the amount raised and our costs (especially with regards to legals and
compliance), we will either:

* Continue with the project â€” albeit delivering at a slightly slower pace than
  expected.

* Put the project on hold and cancel any further payments from sponsors. And
  will, of course, leave all of the GitFund code we'd developed till then as
  open source.

### How do I change the email address for my account?

Sorry, we haven't yet implemented support for changing the email address
associated with your account. We will do so as part of our core dev period
though.

### How do I change my password?

We use a passwordless system to authenticate users on the site. When you want to
sign in, we'll send you an email that contains a special authorised link.

### Are there any countries you definitely won't be supporting?

Given that open source is a global phenomena, we'll try as much as possible to
eventually support every country out there. If we don't support a country, then
it will be primarily due to one of two reasons:

* It's on an economic sanctions list of some kind.

* It has data protection requirements which require all personal data to be
  stored and processed within that territory and we are not able to figure out
  an easy, affordable, and reliable way of doing so for some reason.

### How do I cancel my sponsorship?

You can do so via the [cancel sponsorship page](/cancel.sponsorship).

### Why are displayed details not up-to-date?

In order to make the site load faster, we make extensive use of caching. This
sometimes results in stale information being shown for some time until the
caches get updated.
