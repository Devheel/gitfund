FAQ:

[TOC]

### How do I update my sponsorship details?

You can use the [manage sponsorship page](/manage.sponsorship) to update your
details.

### How do I cancel my monthly sponsorship?

You can use the [cancel sponsorship page](/cancel.sponsorship) to do so.

### What happens if you don't raise your base target?

If we haven't reached the base target within 3 months of announcing the project,
then, depending on the amount raised and our costs (especially with regards to
legals and compliance), we will either:

* Continue with the project â€” albeit delivering at a slightly slower pace than
  expected.

* Put the project on hold and cancel any further payments from sponsors. Leaving
  everything we'd done as open source.

### How do I change the email address for my account?

Sorry, we haven't yet implemented support for changing the email address
associated with your account. We will do so in the future though!

### How do I change my password?

We use a passwordless system to authenticate users on the site. When you want to
sign in, we'll send you an email that contains a special authorised link.

### Why do I have a blank profile picture?

We use the [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) service in order to
automatically find profile pictures based on email addresses. A lot of people
already have a Gravatar profile as it is used by popular services like
WordPress.

If you would like to have a profile picture, please sign up on
[Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) using the same email address you used on
GitFund, and upload the picture you would like to use.

### Why are displayed details not up-to-date?

In order to make the site load faster, we make extensive use of caching. This
sometimes results in stale information being shown for some time until the
caches get updated.
