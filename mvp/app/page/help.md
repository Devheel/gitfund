FAQ:

[TOC]

### Can I get invoices for accounting?

You will eventually be able to download your invoices (including VAT invoices
and credit notes) from the [invoices page](/invoices). This should be ready
within the next four months.

If you need invoices before then, then please email team@gitfund.io and we will
manually generate those invoice documents for you.

### Is it possible to sponsor via bank transfer?

We are ideally trying to get everyone to sponsor using credit/debit cards so as
to validate our model. If you are not able to pay by card for some reason, then
please email team@gitfund.io and we'll try and work something out.

### How do I update my sponsorship details?

You can use the [manage sponsorship page](/manage.sponsorship) to update your
details.

### How do I cancel my monthly sponsorship?

You can use the [cancel sponsorship page](/cancel.sponsorship) to do so.

### How do I change the email address for my account?

Sorry, we haven't yet implemented support for changing the email address
associated with your account. We will do so in the future though!

### How do I change my password?

We use a passwordless system to authenticate users on the site. When you want to
sign in, we'll send you an email that contains a special authorised link.

Although passwordless systems met a lot of resistance at first, they are
becoming increasingly popular now that sites like Medium [are using
it](https://blog.medium.com/signing-in-to-medium-by-email-aacc21134fcd). And
given that most GitFund users are likely to have reliable email access, we felt
it was suitable for our userbase.

### Why do I have a blank profile picture?

We use the [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) service in order to
automatically find profile pictures based on email addresses. A lot of people
already have a Gravatar profile as it is used by popular services like
WordPress.

If you would like to have a profile picture, please sign up on
[Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) using the same email address as you signed
up with on GitFund, and upload the picture you would like to use.

### Why are displayed details not up-to-date?

In order to make the site load faster, we make extensive use of caching. This
sometimes results in stale information being shown for a few minutes while the
caches get updated.
